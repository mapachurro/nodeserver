# nodeserver

Sup yawl.

This is a simple project, as such: build a simple static (maybe some js?) web server on a Raspberry Pi that hosts a website from my house.

I've currently got it running, with Nginx running middleware. It took some fiddling. ISPs suck.

Next step: Configure it to host multiple domains.

Enjoy!
